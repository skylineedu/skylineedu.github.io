      Skyline is a project to help students have all the needed resources in one. From a educational based newsfeed to live chat room system, the sky is the limit with skyline. Students can receive the most current information by collaborating with other students their age, and even know what the next SATs are in just a few clicks. Skyline is meant to organize studnets and give them extra help on planning and executing their wishes.</br></br>

    <p id="info5">
      We are a team of four girls from the Bay Area. All of us are trying are best to create an innovative base where we can all help each other in what seems like the biggest challenge: school. We all practically started in computer science and zero knowledge on developing. This project was only made in 5 days, yet we tried our best to fully integrate all the feature we wanted. From scratch to finsh, no matter at what stage, we did the most we can to make Skyline happen. We all decided to develop Skyline because of the program Girls Who Code, and are working to be the best innovators we can be!
